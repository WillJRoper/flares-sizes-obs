        abstract = {We present the public data release of halo and galaxy catalogues extracted from the eagle suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the gadget code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z=0 galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass?stellar mass relation. The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational database which we are making available for general use. A large number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than 105 galaxies, examples of which are provided in the Appendix. The relatively good and broad agreement of the simulations with a wide range of observational datasets makes the database an ideal resource for the analysis of model galaxies through time, and for connecting and interpreting observational datasets.}

abstract = {We study the sizes of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization using a sample of ∼ 100, 000 galaxies from the BBBBTTTTT cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S} = 7 to 11. We find an inverse relationship between stellar mass and the size measured from stellar mass maps, suggesting that the most massive galaxies are more compact and dense than lower mass galaxies, which have flatter mass distributions. We find a mildly negative relation between intrinsic far-ultraviolet luminosity and size, while we find a positive size-luminosity relation when measured from dust-attenuated images. This suggests that dust is the predominant cause of the observed positive size-luminosity relation, with dust preferentially attenuating bright sight lines resulting in a flatter emission profile and thus larger measured sizes. We study the size-luminosity relation across the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical, and find that the slope decreases at longer wavelengths; this is a consequence of the relation being caused by dust, which produces less attenuation at longer wavelengths. We find that the far-ultraviolet size-luminosity relation shows mild evolution from {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S} = 7 to 11, and galaxy size evolves with redshift as {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± ∝ (1 + {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S}) −{\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± , where {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± = 0.559 ± 0.008. Finally, we investigate the sizes of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}± {\S} = 7 quasar host galaxies, and find that while the intrinsic sizes of quasar hosts are small relative to the overall galaxy sample, they have comparable sizes when measured from dust-attenuated images.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed structural and morphological study of a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z ⩾ 6 using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-IR broad-band images and Subaru Telescope optical narrow-band images. The galaxy sample consists of 51 Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ≃ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at 5.9 ⩽ z ⩽ 6.5. These galaxies exhibit a wide range of rest-frame UV continuum morphology in the HST images, from compact features to multiple component systems. The fraction of merging/interacting galaxies reaches 40\%–50\% at the brightest end of M1500 ⩽ −20.5 mag. The intrinsic half-light radii rhl, in, after correcting for point-spread function (PSF) broadening, are roughly between rhl, in ≃ 0.″05 (0.3 kpc) and 0.″3 (1.7 kpc) at M1500 ⩽ −19.5 mag. The median rhl, in value is 0.″16 (∼0.9 kpc). This is consistent with the sizes of bright LAEs and LBGs at z ⩾ 6 found in previous studies. In addition, more luminous galaxies tend to be larger and exhibit a weak size–luminosity relation, rhl, in∝L0.14 at M1500 ⩽ −19.5 mag. The slope of 0.14 is significantly flatter than those in fainter LBG samples. We discuss the morphology of z ⩾ 6 galaxies with nonparametric methods, including the concentration, asymmetry, and smoothness system and the Gini and M20 parameters, and demonstrate their validity through simulations. We search for extended Lyα emission halos around LAEs at z ≃ 5.7 and 6.5 by stacking a number of narrow-band images. We do not find evidence of extended Lyα halos predicted by cosmological simulations. Such halos, if they exist, could be weaker than predicted. Finally, we investigate positional misalignment between the UV continuum and Lyα emissions in LAEs. While the two positions are generally consistent, several merging galaxies show significant positional differences. This is likely caused by a disturbed interstellar medium distribution due to merging activity.}

Our fiducial model, including strong feedback from supernovae and photoionization background, accurately reproduces the evolution of the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function. Using this model, we study the size–luminosity relation of galaxies and find that the effective radius scales with UV luminosity as Re ∝ L0.25 at z ∼ 5–9. We show that recently discovered very luminous galaxies at z ∼ 7 and 11 lie on our predicted size–luminosity relations. We find that a significant fraction of galaxies at z \\&gt; 8 will not be resolved by James Webb Space Telescope, but Giant Magellan Telescope will have the ability to resolve all galaxies in haloes above the atomic cooling limit. We show that our fiducial model successfully reproduces the redshift evolution of average galaxy sizes at z \\&gt; 5. We also explore galaxy sizes in models without supernova feedback. The no-supernova feedback models produce galaxy sizes that are smaller than observations. We therefore confirm that supernova feedback plays an important role in determining the size–luminosity relation of galaxies and its redshift evolution during reionization.}",

We predict the stellar mass–halo mass relation, stellar mass function, and luminosity function in several bands from z = 5 to 12. The median stellar mass–halo mass relation does not evolve strongly at z = 5–12. The faint-end slope of the luminosity function steepens with increasing redshift, as inherited from the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below z ∼ 6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M* ∼ 104.5 M⊙ (fainter than M1500 ∼ −12), owing to the fact that star formation in low-mass haloes is suppressed by the ionizing background by the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the SFR–Mhalo, SFR–M*, and broad-band magnitude–stellar mass relations. We derive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z = 5–12 and show that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at z \\&gt; 8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z ∼ 6 UV luminosity function brighter than M1500 ∼ −20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37 per cent (54 per cent) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M1500 = −13 (−17) is obscured by dust at z ∼ 6. Our results broadly agree with current data and can be tested by future observations.}",

The sample was initially selected from 1.65 deg2 of ground-based imaging in the UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UDS/SXDS fields, and includes the extreme Lyman α emitters, ‘Himiko’ and ‘CR7’. A deconfusion analysis of the deep Spitzer photometry available suggests that these galaxies exhibit strong rest-frame optical nebular emission lines (EW0(Hβ + [O iii]) \\&gt; 600 Å). We find that irregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging systems are common (fmulti \\&gt; 0.4) in bright z ≃ 7 galaxies, and ubiquitous at the very bright end (MUV \\&lt; −22.5). The galaxies have half-light radii in the range r1/2 ∼ 0.5–3 kpc. The size measurements provide the first determination of the size–luminosity relation at z ≃ 7 that extends to MUV ∼ −23. We find the relation to be steep with r1/2 ∝ L1/2. Excluding clumpy, multicomponent galaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased star formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent, HST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z ≃ 7 favours a power-law decline at the bright end, compared to an exponential Schechter function drop-off. Finally, these results have important implications for the Euclid mission, which we predict will detect \\&gt;1000 similarly bright galaxies at z ≃ 7. Our new HST imaging suggests that the vast majority of these galaxies will be spatially resolved by Euclid, mitigating concerns over dwarf star contamination.}",

a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2{\texttimes}107 dark
matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure
identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), a 1 million s exposure of an 11 arcmin2 region in the southern sky with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope using Director's Discretionary Time. The exposure time was divided among four filters, F435W (B435), F606W (V606), F775W (i 775), and F850LP (z850), to give approximately uniform limiting magnitudes mAB ∼ 29 for point sources. The image contains at least 10,000 objects, presented here as a catalog, the vast majority of which are galaxies. Visual inspection of the images shows few if any galaxies at redshifts greater than ∼4 that resemble present-day spiral or elliptical galaxies. The image reinforces the conclusion from the original Hubble Deep Field that galaxies evolved strongly during the first few billion years in the infancy of the universe. Using the Lyman break dropout method to derive samples of galaxies at redshifts between 4 and 7, it is possible to study the apparent evolution of the galaxy luminosity function and number density. Examination of the catalog for dropout sources yields 504 B435 dropouts, 204 V 606 dropouts, and 54 i775 dropouts. The i775 dropouts are most likely galaxies at redshifts between 6 and 7. Using these samples, which are at different redshifts but derived from the same data, we find no evidence for a change in the characteristic luminosity of galaxies but some evidence for a decrease in their number densities between redshifts of 4 and 7. Assessing the factors needed to derive the luminosity function from the data suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in parameters from samples discovered with different instruments and derived using independent assumptions about the source populations. This assessment calls into question some of the strong conclusions of recently published work on distant galaxies. The ultraviolet luminosity density of these samples is dominated by galaxies fainter than the characteristic luminosity, and the HUDF reveals considerably more luminosity than shallower surveys. The apparent ultraviolet luminosity density of galaxies appears to decrease from redshifts of a few to redshifts greater than 6, although this decrease may be the result of faint-end incompleteness in the most distant samples. The highest redshift samples show that star formation was already vigorous at the earliest epochs at which galaxies have been observed, less than 1 billion years after the big bang.}

In particular we discuss the difference between integral and differential representations of the fluid equations in an SPH context and how this relates to the formulation of dissipative terms for the capture of shocks and other discontinuities. This has important implications for many problems, in particular related to recently highlighted problems in treating Kelvin{\textendash}Helmholtz instabilities across entropy gradients in SPH. The specific problems pointed out by Agertz et al. [O. Agertz, B. Moore, J. Stadel, D. Potter, F. Miniati, J. Read, L. Mayer, A. Gawryszczak, A. Kravtsov, {\r A}. Nordlund, F. Pearce, V. Quilis, D.

Walder, Fundamental differences between SPH and grid methods, MNRAS 380 (2007) 963{\textendash}978] are shown to be related in particular to the (lack of) treatment of contact discontinuities in standard SPH formulations which can be cured by the simple application of an artificial thermal conductivity term. We propose a new formulation of artificial thermal conductivity in SPH which minimises dissipation away from discontinuities and can therefore be applied quite generally in SPH calculations.},

            160 bands. These remarkable data reach ∼1.5 AB mag deeper than the previous data over the HUDF, and now are an excellent match to the HUDF optical ACS data. For our search criteria, we use a two-color Lyman break selection technique to identify z ∼ 8-8.5Y
            105-dropouts. We find five likely z ∼ 8-8.5 candidates. The sources have H
            160-band magnitudes of ∼28.3 AB mag and very blue UV-continuum slopes, with a median estimated β of ≲–2.5 (where f
            λ ∝ λβ). This suggests that z ∼ 8 galaxies are not only essentially dust free but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. The observed number of Y
            105-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20 ± 6 sources expected assuming no evolution from z ∼ 6, but is consistent with the five expected extrapolating the Bouwens et al. luminosity function (LF) results to z ∼ 8. These results provide evidence that the evolution in the LF seen from z ∼ 7 to z ∼ 3 continues to z ∼ 8. The remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of WFC3/IR has enabled Hubble Space Telescope to cross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z∼ 8-9.}

	abstract = {Observations of the most distant bright quasars imply that billion solar mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have to be assembled within the first 800 million years. Under our standard galaxy formation scenario such fast growth implies large gas densities providing sustained accretion at critical or supercritical rates onto an initial black hole seed. It has been a long standing question whether and how such high black hole accretion rates can be achieved and sustained at the centers of early galaxies. Here we use our new MassiveBlack cosmological hydrodynamic simulation covering a volume (0.75 Gpc)3 appropriate for studying the rare first quasars to show that steady high density cold gas flows responsible for assembling the first galaxies produce the high gas densities that lead to sustained critical accretion rates and hence rapid growth commensurate with the existence of ∼109 M
            ☉ black holes as early as z ∼ 7. We find that under these conditions quasar feedback is not effective at stopping the cold gas from penetrating the central regions and hence cannot quench the accretion until the host galaxy reaches . This cold-flow-driven scenario for the formation of quasars implies that they should be ubiquitous in galaxies in the early universe and that major (proto)galaxy mergers are not a requirement for efficient fuel supply and growth, particularly for the earliest SMBHs.}

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within five well-known extragalactic science fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3σ) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated fields, SEDS is subject to roughly 25% smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-field survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2-7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual fields. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each field, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 ± 1.0 and 4.4 ± 0.8 nW m–2 sr–1 at 3.6 and 4.5 μm to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB flux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE flux estimates, half the CIB flux must therefore come from a diffuse component.}

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

We develop new color criteria that more optimally utilize the full wavelength coverage from the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR observations over our search fields, while simultaneously minimizing the incompleteness and eliminating redshift gaps. We have identified 5859, 3001, 857, 481, 217, and 6 galaxy candidates at , , , , , and , respectively, from the ∼1000 arcmin2 area covered by these data sets. This sample of >10,000 galaxy candidates at  is by far the largest assembled to date with HST. The selection of  4–8 candidates over the five CANDELS fields allows us to assess the cosmic variance; the largest variations are at . Our new LF determinations at  and  span a 6 mag baseline and reach to –16 AB mag. These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the larger samples and volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of  galaxies and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings to  significance for a steeper faint-end slope of the UV LF at , with α evolving from  at  to  at  (and  at ), consistent with that expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. We find less evolution in the characteristic magnitude M* from  to  the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes in . No evidence for a non-Schechter-like form to the z ∼ 4–8 LFs is found. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and evolution in the M/L ratio  of halos provides a good representation of the observed evolution.}

    abstract = "{We present the results of a new search for galaxies at redshift z ≃ 9 in the first two Hubble Frontier Fields with completed HST WFC3/IR and ACS imaging. To ensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness, we confine our search to objects with H160 \\&lt; 28.6 (AB mag), consider only image regions with an rms noise σ160 \\&gt; 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec diameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H160 and J140. The result is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for magnification) of 10.9 arcmin2, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 \\&lt; z \\&lt; 9.5. Within the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields, we confirm the three brightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al., but recover only one of the four z \\&gt; 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. In the MACSJ0416.1−240 cluster field, we report five objects, and explain why each of these eluded detection or classification as z ≃ 9 galaxies in the published searches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ≃ 9 galaxies from the MACSJ0416.1−240 parallel field. Based on the published magnification maps, we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is likely boosted by more than a factor of 2 by gravitational lensing. Consequently, we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the normalization of the z ≃ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously in the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence for a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence star formation rate density) from z ≃ 8 to 9, contrary to recent reports of a marked drop-off at these redshifts. This provides further support for the scenario in which early galaxy evolution is sufficiently extended to explain cosmic reionization.}",

	abstract = {We investigate the evolution of galaxy masses and star formation rates in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE) simulations. These comprise a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmogony with subgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and feedback from stars and accreting black holes. The subgrid feedback was calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy sizes. Here we demonstrate that the simulations reproduce the observed growth of the stellar mass density to within 20 per cent. The simulation also tracks the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function out to redshift z = 7, with differences comparable to the plausible uncertainties in the interpretation of the data. Just as with observed galaxies, the specific star formation rates of simulated galaxies are bimodal, with distinct star forming and passive sequences. The specific star formation rates of star forming galaxies are typically 0.2 to 0.4 dex lower than observed, but the evolution of the rates track the observations closely. The unprecedented level of agreement between simulation and data makes EAGLE a powerful resource to understand the physical processes that govern galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We have updated the Munich galaxy formation model to the Planck first-year cosmology, while modifying the treatment of baryonic processes to reproduce recent data on the abundance and passive fractions of galaxies from z = 3 down to z = 0. Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than \~{}1014M?\~{}1014M?\{{\textbackslash}sim \}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, M\_\{\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\}\}, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (log M*/M? >= 11.0) assemble most of their mass before z = 1 and are predominantly old and passive at z = 0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for log M*/M? <= 9.5, are still predominantly blue and star forming at z = 0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.},

A significant spectroscopic continuum break is detected at . The new grism data, combined with the photometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this source. The only viable solution is that this continuum break is the Lyα break redshifted to , just ∼400 Myr after the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic frontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic reionization peak at z ∼ 8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well underway early in the reionization epoch at z > 10. GN-z11 is remarkably, and unexpectedly, luminous for a galaxy at such an early time: its UV luminosity is 3×  larger than  measured at z ∼ 6−8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5 μm of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass of  ∼109 M⊙. This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily confirm such sources at z > 10 and characterize their physical properties through detailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-field near-IR imaging, would find large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to JWST's spectroscopy, if it is launched early enough to overlap with JWST.}

@article{McKinnon2016a,
abstract = {We present full volume cosmological simulations using the moving-mesh code AREPO to study the coevolution of dust and galaxies. We extend the dust model in AREPO to include thermal sputtering of grains and investigate the evolution of the dust mass function, the cosmic distribution of dust beyond the interstellar medium, and the dependence of dust-to-stellar mass ratio on galactic properties. The simulated dust mass function is well-described by a Schechter fit and lies closest to observations at {\$}z = 0{\$}. The radial scaling of projected dust surface density out to distances of {\$}10 \backslash, \backslashtext{\{}Mpc{\}}{\$} around galaxies with magnitudes {\$}17 {\textless} i {\textless} 21{\$} is similar to that seen in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, albeit with a lower normalisation. At {\$}z = 0{\$}, the predicted dust density of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}} \backslashapprox 1.3 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}{\$} lies in the range of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}}{\$} values seen in low-redshift observations. We find that dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass for galaxies living along the star formation main sequence. Moreover, we estimate the {\$}850 \backslash, \backslashmu\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} number density functions for simulated galaxies and analyse the relation between dust-to-stellar flux and mass ratios at {\$}z = 0{\$}. At high redshift, our model fails to produce enough dust-rich galaxies, and this tension is not alleviated by adopting a top-heavy initial mass function. We do not capture a decline in {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}}{\$} from {\$}z = 2{\$} to {\$}z = 0{\$}, which suggests that dust production mechanisms more strongly dependent on star formation may help to produce the observed number of dusty galaxies near the peak of cosmic star formation.},

  7 galaxies, we employ an alternate strategy using deep Spitzer/IRAC data. We identify z ∼ 7.1–9.1 galaxies by selecting z ≳ 6 galaxies from the HST CANDELS data that show quite red IRAC [3.6]−[4.5] colors, indicating strong [O iii]+Hβ lines in the 4.5 μm band. This selection strategy was validated using a modest sample for which we have deep Y-band coverage, and subsequently used to select the brightest z ≥ 7 sources. Applying the IRAC criteria to all HST-selected optical dropout galaxies over the full ∼900 arcmin2 of the CANDELS survey revealed four unusually bright z ∼ 7.1, 7.6, 7.9, and 8.6 candidates. The median [3.6]−[4.5] color of our selected z ∼ 7.1–9.1 sample is consistent with rest-frame [O iii]+Hβ EWs of ∼1500 Å in the [4.5] band. Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy has been independently reported for two of our selected sources, showing Lyα at redshifts of 7.7302 ± 0.0006 and , respectively. We present similar Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy for a third selected galaxy with a probable 4.7σ Lyα line at z
spec = 7.4770 ± 0.0008. All three have H160-band magnitudes of ∼25 mag and are ∼0.5 mag more luminous (M
1600 ∼ −22.0) than any previously discovered z ∼ 8 galaxy, with important implications for the UV luminosity function (LF). Our three brightest and highest redshift z > 7 galaxies all lie within the CANDELS-EGS field, providing a dramatic illustration of the potential impact of field-to-field variance.}

	abstract = {The deep, wide-area (∼800–900 arcmin2) near-infrared/WFC3/IR + Spitzer/IRAC observations over the CANDELS fields have been a remarkable resource for constraining the bright end of high-redshift UV luminosity functions. However, the lack of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)  1.05 μm observations over the CANDELS fields has made it difficult to identify z ∼ 9–10 sources robustly, since such data are needed to confirm the presence of an abrupt Lyman break at 1.2 μm. Here, we report on the successful identification of many such z ∼ 9–10 sources from a new HST program (z9-CANDELS) that targets the highest-probability z ∼ 9–10 galaxy candidates with observations at 1.05 μm, to search for a robust Lyman-break at 1.2 μm. The potential z ∼ 9–10 candidates were preselected from the full HST, Spitzer/IRAC S-CANDELS observations, and the deepest-available ground-based optical+near-infrared observations (CFHTLS-DEEP+HUGS+UltraVISTA+ZFOURGE). We identified 15 credible z ∼ 9–10 galaxies over the CANDELS fields. Nine of these galaxies lie at z ∼ 9 and five are new identifications. Our targeted follow-up strategy has proven to be very efficient in making use of scarce HST time to secure a reliable sample of z ∼ 9–10 galaxies. Through extensive simulations, we replicate the selection process for our sample (both the preselection and follow-up) and use it to improve current estimates for the volume density of bright z ∼ 9 and z ∼ 10 galaxies. The volume densities we find are 5 and  lower, respectively, than those found at z ∼ 8. When compared with the best-fit evolution (i.e., ) in the UV luminosity densities from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 4 integrated to  (−20 mag), these luminosity densities are  and  lower, respectively, than the extrapolated trends. Our new results are broadly consistent with the “accelerated evolution” scenario at z > 8, consistent with that seen in many models.}

BlueTides has a resolution and volume ((400/h ≈ 577)3 cMpc3) providing a population of galaxies that is well matched to depth and area of current observational surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe. At z = 8, BlueTides includes almost 160 000 galaxies with stellar masses \\&gt;108 M⊙. The population of galaxies predicted by BlueTides closely matches observational constraints on both the galaxy stellar mass function and far-UV (150 nm) luminosity function. Galaxies in BlueTides are characterized by rapidly increasing star formation histories. Specific star formation rates decrease with redshift though remain largely insensitive to stellar mass. As a result of the enhanced surface density of metals, more massive galaxies are predicted to have higher dust attenuation resulting in a significant steepening of the observed far-UV luminosity function at high luminosities. The contribution of active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) to the UV luminosities of galaxies with stellar masses 109–10 M⊙ is around 3 per cent on average. Approximately 25 per cent of galaxies with M* ≈ 1010 M⊙ are predicted to have active SMBHs that contribute \\&gt;10 per cent of the total UV luminosity.}",

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We use the largest sample of  galaxies to date from the first four Hubble Frontier Fields clusters to set constraints on the shape of the  luminosity functions (LFs) to fainter than  mag. We quantify, for the first time, the impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more realistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that, for the highly magnified sources, the systematic uncertainties can become extremely large fainter than −14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95% confidence at approximately −12 mag. Our new forward-modeling formalism incorporates the impact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the availability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One public magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy sample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct an LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications () because of differences between the models. The volume densities we derive for faint (≳−17 mag) sources are ∼3–4× lower than one recent report and give a faint-end slope , which is 3.0–3.5σ shallower (including or not including the size uncertainties, respectively). We introduce a new curvature parameter δ to model the faint end of the LF and demonstrate that the observations permit (at 68% confidence) a turn-over at  in the range of −15.3 to −14.2 mag, depending on the assumed lensing model. The present consideration of magnification errors and new size determinations raise doubts about previous reports regarding the form of the LF at . We discuss the implications of our turn-over constraints in the context of recent theoretical predictions.}

Five sources were targeted for follow-up with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), selected from a larger sample of 16 bright ( mag) candidate  Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) identified over 1.6 degrees2 of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. These were selected as Y and J dropouts by leveraging the deep (Y-to- mag, ) NIR data from the UltraVISTA DR3 release, deep ground-based optical imaging from the CFHTLS and Suprime-Cam programs, and Spitzer/IRAC mosaics combining observations from the SMUVS and SPLASH programs. Through the refined spectral energy distributions, which now also include new HyperSuprimeCam g-, r-, i-, z-, and Y-band data, we confirm that 3/5 galaxies have robust , consistent with the initial selection. The remaining 2/5 galaxies have a nominal . However, with HST data alone, these objects have increased probability of being at . We measure mean UV continuum slopes  for the three  galaxies, marginally bluer than similarly luminous  in CANDELS but consistent with previous measurements of similarly luminous galaxies at . The circularized effective radius for our brightest source is 0.9 ± 0.3 kpc, similar to previous measurements for a bright  galaxy and bright  galaxies. Finally, enlarging our sample to include the six brightest  LBGs identified over UltraVISTA (i.e., including three other sources from Labbé et al.) we estimate for the first time the volume density of galaxies at the extreme bright end ( mag) of the  UV luminosity function. Despite this exceptional result, the still large statistical uncertainties do not allow us to discriminate between a Schechter and a double-power-law form.}

    abstract = { I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the Universe from the first galaxies currently observable at z ∼ 6 down to galaxies observable in the local Universe. Observed changes in galaxy structures reveal formation processes that only galaxy structural analyses can provide. This pedagogical review provides a detailed discussion of the major methods used to study galaxies morphologically and structurally, including the well-established visual method for morphology; Sérsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; and nonparametric structural methods [such as the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method and the Gini/M20 parameters, as well as newer structural indices]. These structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies, such as their scale, star-formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results demonstrate how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z ∼ 3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant Universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence, dominated by spirals and ellipticals. Structural methods accurately identify galaxies in mergers and allow measurements of the merger history out to z ∼ 3. I depict properties and evolution of internal structures of galaxies, such as bulges, disks, bars, and at z>1 large star-forming clumps. I describe the structure and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and starbursts/submillimeter galaxies, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. The role of environment in producing structural changes in galaxies over cosmic time is also discussed. Galaxy sizes can also change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2–5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. I conclude with a discussion of how the evolving trends, in sizes, structures, and morphologies, reveal the formation mechanisms behind galaxies and provides a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation. }

We select 39 candidates using the Lyman break technique, for which the clear non-detection in optical make the extreme mid-z interlopers hypothesis unlikely. We also take benefit from samples selected using the previous FF data sets of Abell 2744 and MACS 0416 to improve the constraints on the properties of very high redshift objects. We compute the redshift and the physical properties such emission lines properties, star formation rate, reddening, and stellar mass for all FF objects from their spectral energy distribution using templates including nebular emission lines. We study the relationship between several physical properties and confirm the trend already observed in previous surveys for evolution of star formation rate with galaxy mass and between the size and the UV luminosity of our candidates. The analysis of the evolution of the UV luminosity function with redshift seems more compatible with an evolution of density. Moreover, no robust object is selected behind the cluster field and few candidates have been selected in the two previous data sets from this legacy survey, suggesting a strong evolution in the number density of galaxies between and 9. Thanks to the use of the lensing cluster, we study the evolution of the star formation rate density produced by galaxies with L > 0.03 , and confirm the strong decrease observed between and 9.}

The sizes are measured by determining the best-fit model to galaxy images in the rest-frame 2100 Å with the stellar masses estimated from spectral energy distribution fitting to rest-frame optical (from Spitzer/IRAC) and UV fluxes. We show that the stellar mass–size relation of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) persists, at least to z ∼ 5, and the median size of LBGs at a given stellar mass increases toward lower redshifts. For galaxies with stellar masses of 9.5 < log (M*/M☉) < 10.4, sizes evolve as (1 + z)−1.20 ± 0.11. This evolution is very similar for galaxies with lower stellar masses of 8.6 < log (M*/M☉) < 9.5 which is re∝(1 + z)−1.18 ± 0.10, in agreement with simple theoretical galaxy formation models at high z. Our results are consistent with previous measurements of the LBGs mass–size relation at lower redshifts (z ∼ 1–3).}

We measure the sizes of these candidates to map out the size evolution of galaxies from the earliest observable times. Their sizes are also used to provide a valuable constraint on whether these unusual galaxy candidates are at high redshift. Using galfit to derive sizes from the CANDELS F160W images of these candidates, we find a mean size of (or 0.5 ± 0.1 kpc at z ∼ 9–10). This handsomely matches the 0.6 kpc size expected extrapolating lower-redshift measurements to z ∼ 9–10, while being much smaller than the 0.″59 mean size for lower-redshift interlopers to z ∼ 9–10 photometric selections lacking the blue IRAC color criterion. This suggests that source size may be an effective constraint on contaminants from z ∼ 9–10 selections lacking IRAC data. Assuming on the basis of the strong photometric evidence that the Oesch et al. sample is entirely at z ∼ 9–10, we can use this sample to extend current constraints on the size–luminosity, size–mass relation, and size evolution of galaxies to . We find that the z ∼ 9–10 candidate galaxies have broadly similar sizes and luminosities as –8 counterparts with star formation rate surface densities in the range of . The stellar mass–size relation is uncertain, but shallower than those inferred for lower-redshift galaxies. In combination with previous size measurements at z = 4–7, we find a size evolution of with for galaxies, consistent with the evolution previously derived from galaxies.}

The mock data products are produced by using stellar population synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (SED) to each star particle in the galaxies. The resulting synthetic images and integrated SEDs therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic data products, it is possible to produce monochromatic or colour-composite images, perform SED fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structural properties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, and composition of the image catalogue that makes up the Illustris Simulation Observatory. As a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellar mass estimates by applying the SED fitting code fast to the synthetic galaxy products, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellar masses from the simulation. We find from this idealized experiment that systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that can be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimum galaxy age restriction.}",

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {How stellar mass assembles within galaxies is still an open question. We present measurements of the stellar mass distribution on kiloparsec-scales for ∼5500 galaxies with stellar masses above up to redshift 2.0. We create stellar mass maps from Hubble Space Telescope observations by means of the pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting method. These maps are used to derive radii encompassing 20\%, 50\%, and 80\% (r20, r50, and r80) of the total stellar mass from the best-fit Sérsic models. The reliability and limitations of the structural parameter measurements are checked extensively using a large sample (∼3000) of simulated galaxies. The size–mass relations and redshift evolution of r20, r50, and r80 are explored for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. At fixed mass, the star-forming galaxies do not show significant changes in their r20, r50, and r80 sizes, indicating self-similar growth. Only above the pivot stellar mass of does r80 evolve as r80 ∝ (1 + z)−0.85±0.20, indicating that mass builds up in the outskirts of these systems (inside-out growth). The Sérsic values also increase for the massive star-forming galaxies toward late cosmic time. Massive quiescent galaxies show stronger size evolution at all radii, in particular, the r20 sizes. For these massive galaxies, Sérsic values remain almost constant since at least z ∼ 1.3, indicating that the strong size evolution is related to the changes in the outer parts of these galaxies. We make all the structural parameters publicly available.}

	abstract = {Exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all five CANDELS fields, and accurate redshift information provided by 3D-HST, we investigate the relation between structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764 galaxies above 1010 M☉, spanning the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.5. For the first time, we fit two-dimensional models comprising a single Sérsic fit and two-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light distributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical observations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar mass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sérsic index and bulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40%–50%) among star-forming galaxies above 1011 M☉. Given that quenching for these most massive systems is likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth precedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than the total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art, semi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In this model, bulges and black holes grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and feedback from active galactic nuclei shuts off star formation. Further observations will be required to pin down star formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply that they must be internal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth.}

We confirm that, at fixed redshift and stellar mass over the range of , star-forming galaxies are on average larger than quiescent galaxies. The large sample of galaxies with accurate size measurements, thanks to the excellent imaging quality, also enables us to demonstrate that the R e –M * relations of both populations have a form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slopes at a pivot stellar mass M p . For quiescent galaxies, below an (evolving) pivot mass of , the relation follows ; above M p the relation is steeper and follows . For star-forming galaxies, below the relation follows ; above M p the relation evolves with redshift and follows . The shallow power-law slope for quiescent galaxies below M p indicates that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have sizes similar to those of their counterpart star-forming galaxies. We take this as evidence that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have been recently quenched (presumably through environment-specific processes) without significant structural transformation. Interestingly, the pivot stellar mass of the R e –M * relations for both populations also coincides with the mass at which half of the galaxy population is quiescent, implying that the pivot mass represents the transition of galaxy growth from being dominated by in situ star formation to being dominated by (dry) mergers.}

Here we present the largest catalog to date of galaxy half-mass radii at z > 1: 7006 galaxies in the CANDELS fields at 1.0 ≤ z ≤ 2.5. The sample includes both star-forming and quiescent galaxies with stellar masses . We test three methods for calculating half-mass radii from multiband PSF-matched Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging: two based on spatially resolved spectral energy distribution modeling, and one that uses a rest-frame color profile. All three methods agree, with scatter ≲0.3 dex. In agreement with previous studies, most galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients (the centers are redder than the outskirts, and ). We find that color gradient strength has significant trends with increasing stellar mass, half-light radius, U − V color, and stellar mass surface density. These trends have not been seen before at z > 1. Furthermore, color gradients of star-forming and quiescent galaxies show a similar redshift evolution: they are flat at z ≳ 2, then steeply decrease as redshift decreases. This affects the galaxy mass–size relation. The normalizations of the star-forming and quiescent relations are 10%–40% smaller than the corresponding relations; the slopes are ∼0.1–0.3 dex shallower. Finally, the half-mass radii of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at M* = 1010.5 M⊙ only grow by ∼1% and ∼8% between z ∼ 2.25 and z ∼ 1.25. This is significantly less than the ∼37% and ∼47% size increases found when using the half-light radius.}

	abstract = {Spectroscopic+photometric redshifts, stellar mass estimates, and rest-frame colors from the 3D-HST survey are combined with structural parameter measurements from CANDELS imaging to determine the galaxy size–mass distribution over the redshift range 0 < z < 3. Separating early- and late-type galaxies on the basis of star-formation activity, we confirm that early-type galaxies are on average smaller than late-type galaxies at all redshifts, and we find a significantly different rate of average size evolution at fixed galaxy mass, with fast evolution for the early-type population, Reff∝(1 + z)−1.48, and moderate evolution for the late-type population, Reff∝(1 + z)−0.75. The large sample size and dynamic range in both galaxy mass and redshift, in combination with the high fidelity of our measurements due to the extensive use of spectroscopic data, not only fortify previous results but also enable us to probe beyond simple average galaxy size measurements. At all redshifts the slope of the size–mass relation is shallow, , for late-type galaxies with stellar mass >3 × 109 M☉, and steep, , for early-type galaxies with stellar mass >2 × 1010 M☉. The intrinsic scatter is ≲0.2 dex for all galaxy types and redshifts. For late-type galaxies, the logarithmic size distribution is not symmetric but is skewed toward small sizes: at all redshifts and masses, a tail of small late-type galaxies exists that overlaps in size with the early-type galaxy population. The number density of massive (∼1011 M☉), compact (Reff < 2 kpc) early-type galaxies increases from z = 3 to z = 1.5–2 and then strongly decreases at later cosmic times.}

Using this method, we reduce the catastrophic failure rate significantly and verify the confidence in the fit independently of χ2. Additionally, using the median of the final fitting values and the 16th and 84th percentile produces more realistic error estimates than those provided by galfit, which are known to be underestimated. We use the results of our decompositions to analyse the stellar mass – half-light radius relations of bulges, discs and spheroids.

We find that the sizes increase with stellar mass, but that the relation weakens with increasing redshift. Separating galaxies by their star formation activity, we find that passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies at a fixed stellar mass. These trends are consistent with those found in observations and the level of agreement between the predicted and observed size–mass relations is of the order of 0.1 dex for z \\&lt; 1 and 0.2–0.3 dex from redshift 1 to 2. We use the simulation to compare the evolution of individual galaxies with that of the population as a whole. While the evolution of the size–stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a good proxy for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution of individual passive galaxies is not well represented by the observed size–mass relation due to the evolving number density of passive galaxies. Observations of z ∼ 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance of massive red compact galaxies, which depletes below z ∼ 1. We find that a similar population forms naturally in the simulation. Comparing these galaxies with their z = 0 descendants, we find that all compact galaxies grow in size due to the high-redshift stars migrating outwards. Approximately 60 per cent of the compact galaxies increase in size further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.}",

We find that half-light radii re positively correlates with UV luminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very tight. The largest ( kpc) galaxies are mostly red in UV color while the smallest ( kpc) ones tend to be blue. We also find that galaxies with multiple cores tend to be brighter. Combined with previous results at , our result confirms that the average of bright ((0.3–1)) galaxies scales as with . We find that the ratio of re to virial radius is virtually constant at 3.3 ± 0.1\% over a wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos are derived based on the abundance matching. This constant ratio is consistent with the disk formation model by Mo et al. with , where jd and md are the fractions of the angular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. A comparison with various types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar to circumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that a sizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.}

First, we utilize the increased signal-to-noise ratio offered by the UDF12 imaging to provide improved measurements for known galaxies at z ≃ 6.5–8 in the HUDF. Second, because the UDF12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy sample in the HUDF at z > 8, we have been able to extend the measurement of average galaxy size out to higher redshifts. Restricting our measurements to sources detected at >15σ, we confirm earlier indications that the average half-light radii of z ∼ 7–12 galaxies are extremely small, 0.3–0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations in local star-forming galaxies. We also confirm that there is a clear trend of decreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the first evidence that this trend continues beyond z ≃ 8. Modeling the evolution of the average half-light radius as a power law, ∝(1 + z)s, we obtain a best-fit index of over z ∼ 4–12. A clear size–luminosity relation is evident in our dropout samples. This relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of star formation over a range in luminosity of . The average star formation surface density in dropout galaxies is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that found in extreme starburst galaxies, but is comparable to that seen today in the centers of normal disk galaxies.}

We perform extensive simulations to quantify the dropout-selection completenesses and measurement biases and uncertainties in two-dimensional size and magnitude bins, and transform the theoretical size–luminosity distribution to the expected distribution for the observed data. Using maximum-likelihood estimator, we find that the Schechter function parameters for B435-dropouts and are consistent with the values in the literature, but the size distributions are wider than expected from the angular momentum distribution of the underlying dark matter halos. The slope of the size–luminosity (RL) relation is similar to those found for local disk galaxies, but considerably shallower than local early-type galaxies.}

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 3.8 ≲ z ≲ 4.5. This sample consists of a photometric catalog of 244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 deg2 to an apparent magnitude of IAB = 25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61 ≤ z ≤ 4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is ⟨z⟩ = 4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large survey for Lyman-break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7 ≲ z ≲ 3.4) allows a relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z ~ 4 and z ~ 3 are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total integrated UV luminosity densities [ρUV(z = 3)/ρUV(z = 4) = 1.1 ± 0.3]. We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble deep field (HDF). The HDF provides the only existing data on Lyman-break galaxy number densities at fainter magnitudes. We have reanalyzed the z ~ 3 and z ~ 4 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF using our improved knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies, and we find, like previous authors, that faint Lyman-break galaxies appear to be rarer at z ~ 4 than z ~ 3. This might signal a large change in the faint-end slope of the Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts z ~ 3 and z ~ 4, or, more likely, be due to significant variance in the number counts within the small volumes probed by the HDF at high redshifts (~160 times smaller than the ground-based surveys discussed here).

If the true luminosity density at z ~ 4 is somewhat higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially constant for all z > 1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star formation activity and that the onset of substantial star formation in galaxies might occur at z ≳ 4.5.}

Assuming various attenuation laws, we compute photometry by extincting each star particle’s spectrum using the line-of-sight gas metal column density. The predicted ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) generally agrees with observations at z = 6, owing to a partial cancellation between the high metallicities of the simulated galaxies and lower dust-to-metal ratios. The simulated z = 8 UVLF is low compared to observations, likely owing to excessive dust extinction. simba predicts UV continuum slopes (β) in agreement with the z = 6 observations, with the best agreement obtained using a Calzetti extinction law. Interestingly, the gas-phase mass–metallicity relation in simba is higher at z ∼ 6 than at z ∼ 2, suggesting that rapid early enrichment (and dust growth) might be necessary to match the observed β. We find that β is more sensitive to the dust extinction law than the UVLF. By generating mock James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images and analysing in a manner similar to observations, we show that simba’s galaxy size–luminosity relation well reproduces the current z = 6 Hubble observations. Unlike observations at lower redshifts, simba predicts similar rest-UV and rest-optical sizes of z = 6 galaxies, owing to weak age gradients and dust extinction in star-forming regions counteract each other to weaken the colour gradients within galaxies. These predictions will be testable with JWST.}",

	abstract = {The peak star formation intensity in starburst galaxies does not vary significantly from the local universe to redshift z ∼ 6. We arrive at this conclusion through new surface brightness measurements of 47 starburst galaxies at z ≃ 5–6, doubling the redshift range for such observations. These galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) through the GRism ACS program for Extragalactic Science (GRAPES) project. The starburst intensity limit for galaxies at z ≃ 5–6 agrees with those at z ≃ 3–4 and z ≃ 0 to within a factor of a few, after correcting for cosmological surface brightness dimming and for dust. The most natural interpretation of this constancy over cosmic time is that the same physical mechanisms limit starburst intensity at all redshifts up to z ≃ 6 (be they galactic winds, gravitational instability, or something else). We do see two trends with redshift: First, the UV spectral slope (β) of galaxies at z ≃ 5–6 is bluer than that of z ≃ 3 galaxies, suggesting an increase in dust content over time. Second, the galaxy sizes from z ≃ 3 to 6 scale approximately as the Hubble parameter H−1(z) . Thus, galaxies at z ≃ 6 are high-redshift starbursts, much like their local analogs except for slightly bluer colors, smaller physical sizes, and correspondingly lower overall luminosities. If we now assume a constant maximum star formation intensity, the differences in observed surface brightness between z ≃ 0 and 6 are consistent with standard expanding cosmology and strongly inconsistent with the tired light model.}

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We construct z ∼ 6–7, 8, and 9 faint Lyman break galaxy samples (334, 61, and 37 galaxies, respectively) with accurate size measurements with the software glafic from the complete Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) cluster and parallel fields data. These are the largest samples hitherto and reach down to the faint ends of recently obtained deep luminosity functions. At faint magnitudes, however, these samples are highly incomplete for galaxies with large sizes, implying that derivation of the luminosity function sensitively depends on the intrinsic size–luminosity relation. We thus conduct simultaneous maximum-likelihood estimation of luminosity function and size–luminosity relation parameters from the observed distribution of galaxies on the size–luminosity plane with the help of a completeness map as a function of size and luminosity. At z ∼ 6–7, we find that the intrinsic size–luminosity relation expressed as r
e ∝ L

β
 has a notably steeper slope of  than those at lower redshifts, which in turn implies that the luminosity function has a relatively shallow faint-end slope of . This steep β can be reproduced by a simple analytical model in which smaller galaxies have lower specific angular momenta. The β and α values for the z ∼ 8 and 9 samples are consistent with those for z ∼ 6–7 but with larger errors. For all three samples, there is a large, positive covariance between β and α, implying that the simultaneous determination of these two parameters is important. We also provide new strong lens mass models of Abell S1063 and Abell 370, as well as updated mass models of Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1−2403.}

	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We present an analysis of all prime HST legacy fields spanning >800 arcmin2 in the search for z ∼ 10 galaxy candidates and the study of their UV luminosity function (LF). In particular, we present new z ∼ 10 candidates selected from the full Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) data set. Despite the addition of these new fields, we find a low abundance of z ∼ 10 candidates with only nine reliable sources identified in all prime HST data sets that include the HUDF09/12, the HUDF/XDF, all of the CANDELS fields, and now the HFF survey. Based on this comprehensive search, we find that the UV luminosity function decreases by one order of magnitude from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 10 over a four-magnitude range. This also implies a decrease of the cosmic star formation rate density by an order of magnitude within 170 Myr from z ∼ 8 to z ∼ 10. We show that this accelerated evolution compared to lower redshift can entirely be explained by the fast build up of the dark matter halo mass function at z > 8. Consequently, the predicted UV LFs from several models of galaxy formation are in good agreement with this observed trend, even though the measured UV LF lies at the low end of model predictions. The difference is generally still consistent within the Poisson and cosmic variance uncertainties. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope mission, which is poised to find much larger samples of z ∼ 10 galaxies as well as their progenitors at less than 400 Myr after the big bang.},

We predict that during the early stages of assembly of the cluster at \\$z\\$ ≳ 3, where the star formation activity is at its maximum in our simulations, the proto-cluster regions are rich in dusty gas. Compared to the case in which only dust production in stellar ejecta is active, if we include processes occurring in the cold ISM, the dust content is enhanced by a factor 2–3. However, the dust properties in this stage turn out to be significantly different from those observationally derived for the average Milky Way dust, and commonly adopted in calculations of dust reprocessing. We show that these differences may have a strong impact on the predicted spectral energy distributions. At low redshift in star-forming regions our model reproduces reasonably well the trend of dust abundances over metallicity as observed in local galaxies. However we underproduce by a factor of 2–3 the total dust content of clusters estimated observationally at low redshift, \\$z\\$ ≲ 0.5 using IRAS, Planck, and Herschel satellites data. This discrepancy does not subsist by assuming a lower sputtering efficiency, which erodes dust grains in the hot intracluster medium.}",

The galaxies show a variety of morphologies, from compact to clumpy to irregular. The simulated galaxies have more extended morphologies and larger sizes when measured using rest-frame optical B-band light than rest-frame UV light; sizes measured from stellar mass surface density are even larger. The UV morphologies are usually dominated by several small, bright young stellar clumps that are not always associated with significant stellar mass. The B-band light traces stellar mass better than the UV, but it can also be biased by the bright clumps. At all redshifts, galaxy size correlates with stellar mass/luminosity with large scatter. The half-light radii range from 0.01 to 0.2 arcsec (0.05–1 kpc physical) at fixed magnitude. At z ≥ 5, the size of galaxies at fixed stellar mass/luminosity evolves as (1 + z)−m, with m ∼ 1–2. For galaxies less massive than M* ∼ 108 M⊙, the ratio of the half-mass radius to the halo virial radius is \\$\\{\\sim \\}10\\hbox\\{ per cent\\}\\$ and does not evolve significantly at z = 5–10; this ratio is typically 1–5 per cent for more massive galaxies. A galaxy's ‘observed’ size decreases dramatically at shallower surface brightness limits.

The global light profiles of most galaxies show disk-like properties well described by a single Sérsic profile with , with only requiring a high Sérsic index, all more massive than . In bulge+disk fits, about 40% of galaxies have a measurable bulge component in the light profiles, with showing a substantial bulge-to-total ratio (B/T) . This is a lower limit to the frequency of z ∼ 2 massive galaxies with a developed bulge component in stellar mass because it could be hidden by dust and/or outshined by a thick actively star-forming disk component. The galaxies’ rest-optical half-light radii range between 1 and 7 kpc, with a median of 2.1 kpc, and lie slightly above the size–mass relation at these epochs reported in the literature. This is attributed to differences in sample selection and definitions of size and/or mass measurements. The color gradient and scatter within individual z ∼ 2 massive galaxies with are as high as in z = 0 low-mass, late-type galaxies and are consistent with the high star formation rates of massive z ∼ 2 galaxies being sustained at large galactocentric distances.}

    abstract = "{We study how the sizes and radial profiles of galaxies vary with wavelength, by fitting Sérsic functions simultaneously to imaging in nine optical and near-infrared bands. To quantify the wavelength dependence of effective radius we use the ratio, \\$\\mathcal \\{R\\}\\$, of measurements in two rest-frame bands. The dependence of Sérsic index on wavelength, \\$\\mathcal \\{N\\}\\$, is computed correspondingly. Vulcani et al. have demonstrated that different galaxy populations present sharply contrasting behaviour in terms of \\$\\mathcal \\{R\\}\\$ and \\$\\mathcal \\{N\\}\\$. Here we study the luminosity dependence of this result. We find that at higher luminosities, early-type galaxies display a more substantial decrease in effective radius with wavelength, whereas late types present a more pronounced increase in Sérsic index. The structural contrast between types thus increases with luminosity. By considering samples at different redshifts, we demonstrate that lower data quality reduces the apparent difference between the main galaxy populations. However, our conclusions remain robust to this effect. We show that accounting for different redshift and luminosity selections partly reconciles the size variation measured by Vulcani et al. with the weaker trends found by other recent studies. Dividing galaxies by visual morphology confirms the behaviour inferred using morphological proxies, although the sample size is greatly reduced. Finally, we demonstrate that varying dust opacity and disc inclination can account for features of the joint distribution of \\$\\mathcal \\{R\\}\\$ and \\$\\mathcal \\{N\\}\\$ for late-type galaxies. However, dust does not appear to explain the highest values of \\$\\mathcal \\{R\\}\\$ and \\$\\mathcal \\{N\\}\\$. The bulge–disc nature of galaxies must also contribute to the wavelength dependence of their structure.}",

We fit single-component, wavelength-dependent, elliptical Sérsic models to all passbands simultaneously, using software developed by the MegaMorph project. Dividing our sample by n and colour, the recovered wavelength variations in effective radius (Re) and Sérsic index (n) reveal the internal structure, and hence formation history, of different types of galaxies. All these trends depend on n; some have an additional dependence on galaxy colour. Late-type galaxies (nr \\&lt; 2.5) show a dramatic increase in Sérsic index with wavelength. This might be a result of their two-component (bulge–disc) nature, though stellar population gradients within each component and dust attenuation are likely to play a role. All galaxies show a substantial decrease in Re with wavelength. This is strongest for early types (nr \\&gt; 2.5), even though they maintain constant n with wavelength, revealing that ellipticals are a superimposition of different stellar populations associated with multiple collapse and merging events. Processes leading to structures with larger Re must be associated with lower metallicity or younger stellar populations. This appears to rule out the formation of young cores through dissipative gas accretion as an important mechanism in the recent lives of luminous elliptical galaxies.}",

In order to facilitate this study we developed Structural Investigation of Galaxies via Model Analysis (sigma), an r wrapper around several contemporary astronomy software packages including source extractor, psf extractor and galfit 3. sigma produces realistic 2D model fits to galaxies, employing automatic adaptive background subtraction and empirical point spread function measurements on the fly for each galaxy in GAMA. Using these results, we define a common coverage area across the three GAMA regions containing 138 269 galaxies. We provide Sérsic magnitudes truncated at 10re which show good agreement with SDSS Petrosian and GAMA photometry for low Sérsic index systems (n \\&lt; 4), and much improved photometry for high Sérsic index systems (n \\&gt; 4), recovering as much as Δm= 0.5 mag in the r band. We employ a K-band Sérsic index/u−r colour relation to delineate the massive (n \\&gt; ∼2) early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the late-type galaxies (LTGs). The mean Sérsic index of these ETGs shows a smooth variation with wavelength, increasing by 30 per cent from g through K. LTGs exhibit a more extreme change in Sérsic index, increasing by 52 per cent across the same range. In addition, ETGs and LTGs exhibit a 38 and 25 per cent decrease, respectively, in half-light radius from g through K. These trends are shown to arise due to the effects of dust attenuation and stellar population/metallicity gradients within galaxy populations.}",

The sample of spheroids consists of 5080 bright (Mr \\&lt; −20) early-type galaxies (ETGs), in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095, with optical (griz) photometry and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) and near-infrared (YJHK) photometry from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Large Area Survey (UKIDSS-LAS) (DR4). We describe how homogeneous photometric parameters (galaxy colours and structural parameters) are derived using grizYJHK wavebands. We find no systematic steepening of the colour–magnitude relation when probing the baseline from g−r to g−K, implying that internal colour gradients drive most of the mass–metallicity relation in ETGs. As far as structural parameters are concerned we find that the mean effective radius of ETGs smoothly decreases, by 30 per cent, from g through K, while no significant dependence on waveband is detected for the axial ratio, Sersic index and a4 parameters. Furthermore, velocity dispersions are remeasured for all the ETGs using starlight and compared to those obtained by SDSS. The velocity dispersions are rederived using a combination of simple stellar population models as templates, hence accounting for the kinematics of different galaxy stellar components. We compare our (2dphot) measurements of total magnitude, effective radius and mean surface brightness with those obtained as part of the SDSS pipeline (photo). Significant differences are found and reported, including comparisons with a third and independent part. A full characterization of the sample completeness in all wavebands is presented, establishing the limits of application of the characteristic parameters presented here for the analysis of the global scaling relations of ETGs.}",

We couple the radiative transfer code SKIRT to the output of the TNG50 simulation and measure the dust-continuum half-light radius of the modelled galaxies, assuming a Milky Way dust type and a metallicity-dependent dust-to-metal ratio. The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850 \\$\\mu\\$m is up to ∼75 per cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but significantly more compact than the observed-frame 1.6 \\$\\mu\\$m (roughly corresponding to H band) half-light radius, particularly towards high redshifts: the compactness compared to the 1.6 \\$\\mu\\$m emission increases with redshift. This is driven by obscuration of stellar light from the galaxy centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6 \\$\\mu\\$m disc sizes relative to that at 850 \\$\\mu\\$m. The difference in relative extents increases with redshift because the observed-frame 1.6 \\$\\mu\\$m emission stems from ever shorter wavelength stellar emission.

To be comprehensive, we also discuss 28 mostly lower likelihood z ∼ 9–10 candidates, including some sources that seem to be reliably at z > 8 using the HST+IRAC data alone, but which the ground-based data show are much more likely at z  8, with a factor of ∼10 evolution seen in the luminosity density from z ∼ 10 to z ∼ 8.}

 < 25.5. Four of these objects were originally reported in Calvi et al. Combining new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/F814W imaging and Spitzer IRAC data with archival imaging from BoRG and other surveys, we explore the properties of these galaxies. Photometric redshift fitting places six of these galaxies in the redshift range of 7.1 < z < 8.0, resulting in three new high-redshift galaxies and confirming three of the four high-redshift galaxy candidates from Calvi et al. We calculate the half-light radii of the Super Eight galaxies using the HST F160W filter and find that the Super Eight sizes are in line with the typical evolution of size with redshift. The Super Eights have a mean mass of log (M
*/M
⊙) ∼10, which is typical for sources in this luminosity range. Finally, we place our sample on the UV z ∼ 8 luminosity function and find that the Super Eight number density is consistent with other surveys in this magnitude and redshift range.}

	abstract = {We have updated the Munich galaxy formation model, L-GALAXIES, to follow 
the radial distributions of stars and atomic and molecular gas in galaxy
discs. We include an H2-based star-formation law, as well as
a detailed chemical-enrichment model with explicit mass-dependent delay
times for SN-II, SN-Ia, and AGB stars. Information about the star
formation, feedback, and chemical-enrichment histories of discs is
stored in 12 concentric rings. The new model retains the success of its
predecessor in reproducing the observed evolution of the galaxy
population, in particular, stellar mass functions and passive fractions
over the redshift range 0 <= z <= 3 and mass range 8<= log
(M\_*/M\_\{?\})<= 12, the black hole-bulge mass relation at z = 0,
galaxy morphology as a function of stellar mass and the mass-metallicity
relations of both stellar and gas components. In addition, its detailed
modelling of the radial structure of discs allows qualitatively new
comparisons with observation, most notably with the relative sizes and
masses of the stellar, atomic, and molecular components in discs. Good
agreement is found with recent data. Comparison of results obtained for
simulations differing in mass resolution by more than two orders of
magnitude shows that all important distributions are numerically well
converged even for this more detailed model. An examination of
metallicity and surface-density gradients in the stars and gas indicates
that our new model, with star formation, chemical enrichment, and
feedback calculated self-consistently on local disc scales, reproduces
some but not all of the trends seen in recent many-galaxy IFU surveys.},

	abstract = {We present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the "Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments" (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

We find that the choice of division between early and late (i.e. colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical; however, the adopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e. the careful rejection of outliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. In particular, we note that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits (\\$\\{\\&lt;\\}10^\\{10\\}\\mathcal \\{M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\$) the Sérsic index bimodality, evident for high-mass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separator of early- and late-type systems. The final set of stellar mass–half-light radius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10 bands (ugrizZY JHKs) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-z benchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. Exploring the variation of the stellar mass–half-light radius relations with wavelength, we confirm earlier findings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at a smaller level than previously noted: at \\$10^\\{10\\}\\mathcal \\{M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\$ both spiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13 per cent from g to Ks (which is near linear in log wavelength). Finally, we note that the sizes used in this work are derived from 2D Sérsic light profile fitting (using galfit3), i.e. elliptical semimajor half-light radii, improving on earlier low-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.}",

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {[Abridged] We present the first results of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies to z=0 in spherical regions of radius {\textasciitilde}20 Mpc/h drawn from the Millennium Simulation. The regions have overdensities that deviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the rms mass fluctuation on a scale of {\textasciitilde}20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass resolution of up to 10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale environments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 Millennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising background, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR density at z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an order of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces observational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the GOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear in the underdense regions until z{\textasciitilde}3. These environmental variations are not caused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but rather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to another, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions. At all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity {\textasciitilde} 250 km/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of "downsizing" (even in the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have mostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form at later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star formation in massive galaxies at late times.},

	abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 Msolar and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc{\textasciitilde}0.08 Msolar and a variance in logarithmic mass $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc{\textasciitilde}0.2
Msolar and $\sigma${\textasciitilde}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD{\textasciitilde}n*{\textasciitilde}0.1
pc-3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc{\textasciitilde}0.2-0.3 Msolar, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\textasciitilde}1 Msolar. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.

Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.

	abstract = {We employ cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate models 
in which the supermassive black holes powering luminous z \~{} 6
quasars (QSOs) grow from massive seeds. We simulate 18 regions with
densities ranging from the mean cosmic density to the highest $\sigma$
peaks in the Millennium simulation volume. Only in the most massive
haloes situated in the most overdense regions, can black holes grow to
masses up to ?109 M? by z \~{} 6 without
invoking super-Eddington accretion. Accretion on to the most massive
black holes becomes limited by thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN)
feedback by z \~{} 9-8 with further growth proceeding in short
Eddington-limited bursts. Our modelling suggests that current
flux-limited surveys of QSOs at high redshift preferentially detect
objects at their peak luminosity and therefore miss a substantial
population of QSOs powered by similarly massive black holes but with low
accretion rates. To test whether the required host halo masses are
consistent with the observed galaxy environments of z \~{} 6 QSOs, we
produce realistic rest-frame UV images of our simulated galaxies.
Without strong stellar feedback, our simulations predict numbers of
bright galaxies larger than observed by a factor of 10 or more.
Supernova-driven galactic winds reduce the predicted numbers to a level
consistent with observations indicating that stellar feedback was
already very efficient at high redshifts. We further investigate the
effect of thermal AGN feedback on the surrounding gas. AGN outflows are
highly anisotropic and mostly energy driven, pushing gas at ?1000
km s-1 out to tens of kpc consistently with observations. The
spatially extended thermal X-ray emission around bright QSOs is powered
by these outflows and is an important diagnostic of the mechanism
whereby AGN feedback energy couples to surrounding gas.},

	abstract = {We examine galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), metallicities, and gas contents predicted by the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which employ meshless hydrodynamics and novel feedback prescriptions that yield a good match to observed galaxy stellar mass assembly. We combine 50, 25, and 12.5 Mpc/h boxes with a quarter billion particles each to show that MUFASA broadly reproduces a wide range of relevant observations, including SFR and specific SFR functions, the mass-metallicity relation, HI and H2 fractions, HI (21 cm) and CO luminosity functions, and cosmic gas density evolution. There are mild but significant discrepancies, such as too many high-SFR galaxies, overly metal-rich and HI-poor galaxies at M*{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} Mo, and sSFRs that are too low at z{\textasciitilde}1-2. The HI mass function increases by x2 out to z{\textasciitilde}1 then steepens to higher redshifts, while the CO luminosity function computed using the Narayanan et al. conversion factor shows a rapid increase of CO-bright galaxies out to z{\textasciitilde}2 in accord with data. Omega\_HI and Omega\_H2 both scale roughly as (1+z){\textasciicircum}0.7 out to z{\textasciitilde}3, comparable to the rise in HI and H2 fractions. MUFASA galaxies with high SFR at a given M* have lower metallicities and higher HI and H2 fractions, following observed trends; we make quantitative predictions for how fluctuations in the baryon cycle drive correlated scatter around galaxy scaling relations. Most of these trends are well converged with numerical resolution. These successes highlight MUFASA as a viable platform to study many facets of cosmological galaxy evolution.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation during the epoch of reionisation in an effort towards modelling the interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting ALMA observations. Simulations with and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens of kpc), and small (sub kpc) scales to highlight the differences local stellar radiation can make for the distribution of neutral hydrogen internally to galaxy and externally on the surrounding filaments and intergalactic medium (IGM). At large scales, we find that the dense regions around galaxies reionise first before UV photons penetrate the voids; however, there remains a considerable amount of neutral gas present within the galaxies. The spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anti-correlated with the presence of stars older than a few Myrs. Likewise, H\$\_2\$ masses in the galaxies are extremely time variable and sensitive to the presence of these same stars. For our specific feedback implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of galaxies and they are proportionally distributed over the ionised and neutral medium by mass. For our most massive galaxy with \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_h\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we find that the majority of the CII mass in the galaxy is associated with cold neutral clumps, similar to OI. NII is more diffuse and arises in warmer gas while OIII is associated with the hotter gas produced by photo-heating and supernovae that has a higher ionisation parameter. If small pockets of high metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from these ions may be observable by ALMA while the naturally low metallicity of the galaxy will cause these systems to fall below the local [CII]-SFR relation.

	abstract = {(submitted to MNRAS January 10, 2017) We present synthetic observations for the first generations of galaxies in the Universe and make predictions for future deep field observations for redshifts greater than 6. Due to the strong impact of nebular emission lines and the relatively compact scale of HII regions, high resolution cosmological simulations and a robust suite of analysis tools are required to properly simulate spectra. We created a software pipeline consisting of FSPS, Hyperion, Cloudy and our own tools to generate synthetic IR observations from a fully three-dimensional arrangement of gas, dust, and stars. Our prescription allows us to include emission lines for a complete chemical network and tackle the effect of dust extinction and scattering in the various lines of sight. We provide spectra, 2-D binned photon imagery for both HST and JWST IR filters, luminosity relationships, and emission line strengths for a large sample of high redshift galaxies in the Renaissance Simulations (O'Shea et al. 2015). Our resulting synthetic spectra show high variability between galactic halos with a strong dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, gas mass fraction, and formation history. Halos with the lowest stellar mass have the greatest variability in [OIII]/H\${\textbackslash}beta\$, [OIII] and CIII] while halos with higher masses are seen to show consistency in their spectra and [OIII] equivalent widths (EW) between 1{\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} and 10{\textbackslash}AA. Viewing angle accounted for three-fold difference in flux due to the presence of ionized gas channels in a halo. Furthermore, JWST color plots show a discernible relationship between redshift, color, and mean stellar age.},

This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of
observational surveys of galaxies.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched 14 May 2009 and has been scanning the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 August 2009. In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and
characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the Planck data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model of
cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature
distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25$\sigma$. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. Planck's results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Planck finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma$8)
derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The Planck and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of E-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

	abstract = {We study the nature of rapidly star-forming galaxies at z=2 in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare their properties to observations of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs). We identify simulated SMGs as the most rapidly star-forming systems that match the observed number density of SMGs. In our models, SMGs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potential wells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparable to their star formation rates (SFR). They are not typically undergoing major mergers that significantly boost their quiescent SFR, but they still often show complex gas morphologies and kinematics. Our simulated SMGs have stellar masses of log M*/Mo{\textasciitilde}11-11.7, SFRs of {\textasciitilde}180-500 Mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 Mpc/h, and solar metallicities. The SFRs are lower than those inferred from far-IR data by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematic effects in the SFR calibrations. SMGs at z=2 live in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}13 Mo halos, and by z=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 Mo halos. We predict that higher-M* SMGs should have on average lower specific SFRs, less disturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. We also predict that deeper far-IR surveys will smoothly join SMGs onto the massive end of the SFR-M* relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. Overall, our simulated rapid star-formers provide as good a match to available SMG data as merger-based scenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally from cosmological simulations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01769},
	abstract = {To understand the evolution of extinction curve, we calculate the dust evolution in a galaxy using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations incorporating stellar dust production, dust destruction in supernova shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by shattering. The dust species are separated into carbonaceous dust and silicate. The evolution of grain size distribution is considered by dividing grain population into large and small gains, which allows us to estimate extinction curves. We examine the dependence of extinction curves on the position, gas density, and metallicity in the galaxy, and find that extinction curves are flat at \$t {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.3\$ Gyr because stellar dust production dominates the total dust abundance. The 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise become prominent after dust growth by accretion. At \$t {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr, shattering works efficiently in the outer disc and low density regions, so extinction curves show a very strong 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and steep FUV rise. The extinction curves at \$t{\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ Gyr are consistent with the Milky Way extinction curve, which implies that we successfully included the necessary dust processes in the model. The outer disc component caused by stellar feedback has an extinction curves with a weaker 2175 {\textbackslash}AA{\textbackslash} bump and flatter FUV slope. The strong contribution of carbonaceous dust tends to underproduce the FUV rise in the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve, which supports selective loss of small carbonaceous dust in the galaxy. The snapshot at young ages also explain the extinction curves in high-redshift quasars.},

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

We predict the stellar mass-halo mass relation, stellar mass function, and luminosity function in several bands from z=5-12. The median stellar mass-halo mass relation does not evolve strongly at z=5-12. The faint-end slope of the luminosity function steepens with increasing redshift, as inherited from the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below z{\textasciitilde}6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M\_star{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}4.5 M\_sun (fainter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-14), owing to the fact that star formation in low-mass halos is suppressed by the ionizing background by the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the SFR-M\_halo, SFR-M\_star, and broad-band magnitude-stellar mass relations. We derive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z=5-12 and show that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at z{\textgreater}8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z{\textasciitilde}6 UV luminosity function brighter than M\_1500{\textasciitilde}-20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37\% (54\%) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M\_1500=-13 (-17) is obscured by dust at z{\textasciitilde}6. Our results broadly agree with current data and can be tested by future observations.},

Our fiducial (50 Mpc/h){\textasciicircum}3 volume is evolved to z=0 with a quarter billion particles, The predicted galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) reproduce observations from z=4-0 to {\textless}1.2sigma in cosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The cosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement with data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf galaxies form the majority of their stars after z{\textasciitilde}1. We run 25 Mpc/h and 12.5 Mpc/h volumes to z=2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling halos, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z=0, but are underpredicted at z{\textasciitilde}2 by a factor of three, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the {\textasciitilde}x2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parameterising feedback.},

In addition, we present a compilation of UV, IR and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z {\textless} 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic Star Formation Rates (SFRs) for \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0-8\$ as well. We demonstrate that SNe feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 1-10 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z {\textless} 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (\$z {\textbackslash}sim 2\$) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100 {\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\} {\textbackslash}, yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively rare high mass halos (\$ \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{Halo\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11-13\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) even at the earliest epochs.},

We calculate the X-ray properties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating the bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution throughout the intracluster medium are a good match to the observations.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Hydrangea simulations, a suite of 24 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}200c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}15.4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) with baryon particle masses of ?10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Designed to study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key part of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project. They use a galaxy formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at stellar masses M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, this environmental effect is quantitatively consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are fewer low-mass (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}star{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ? 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) galaxies within the virial radius of clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching. Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (\&gt;5 r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}200c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of (sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to ?0.3 dex even well beyond r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}200c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.},

Searching for protoclusters on a scale of \~{}10 cMpc gives an excellent compromise between the completeness and purity of their galaxy populations, leads to high distinction from the field in overdensity space, and allows accurate determination of the descendant cluster mass. This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We present a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the protocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of modelling assumptions,
particularly taking into account the shape of the measurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities compared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship between active galactic nucleus (AGN) and protoclusters is also investigated and shows significant evolution with redshift; at z \~{} 2, the fraction of protoclusters traced by AGN is high, but the fraction of all AGNs in protoclusters is low, whereas at z >= 5 the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGNs are in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a passive sequence in
protoclusters at z \~{} 2, and note that a significant fraction of
all galaxies reside in protoclusters at z >= 2, particularly the most massive.},

	abstract = {The scatter (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm{\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$) of the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of galaxies is a measure of the diversity in their star formation histories (SFHs) at a given mass. In this paper we employ the EAGLE simulations to study the dependence of the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ of galaxies on stellar mass (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$) through the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation in \$ \{{\textbackslash}rm z {\textbackslash}sim 0-4\}\$. We find that the relation evolves with time, with the dispersion depending on both stellar mass and redshift. The models point to an evolving U-shape form for the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation with the scatter being minimal at a characteristic mass \$M{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ of \$\{{\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\}\$ \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ and increasing both at lower and higher masses. This implication is that the diversity of SFHs increases towards both at the low- and high-mass ends. We find that active galactic nuclei feedback is important for increasing the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ for high mass objects. On the other hand, we suggest that SNe feedback increases the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$ of galaxies at the low-mass end. We also find that excluding galaxies that have experienced recent mergers does not significantly affect the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation. Furthermore, we employ the combination of the EAGLE simulations with the radiative transfer code SKIRT to evaluate the effect of SFR/stellar mass diagnostics in the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation and find that the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm SFR/M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ methodologies (e.g. SED fitting, UV+IR, UV+IRX-\${\textbackslash}beta\$) widely used in the literature to obtain intrinsic properties of galaxies have a large effect on the derived shape and normalization of the \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sSFR\}\}\}\$-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ relation.},

However, SIMBA also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z = 0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies. We show that SIMBA's jet feedback is primarily responsible for quenching massive galaxies.},

	volume = {1909},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190901348P},
	abstract = {Next generation observatories will enable us to study the first billion 
years of our Universe in unprecedented detail. Foremost among these are
21-cm interferometry with the HERA and the SKA, and high-\$z\$ galaxy
observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Taking a basic
galaxy model, in which we allow the star formation rates and ionizing
escape fractions to have a power-law dependence on halo mass with an
exponential turnover below some threshold, we quantify how observations
from these instruments can be used to constrain the astrophysics of
high-\$z\$ galaxies. For this purpose, we generate mock JWST LFs, based on
two different hydrodynamical cosmological simulations; these have
intrinsic luminosity functions (LFs) which turn over at different scales
and yet are fully consistent with present-day observations. We also
generate mock 21-cm power spectrum observations, using 1000h
observations with SKA1 and a moderate foreground model. Using only JWST
data, we predict up to a factor of 2-3 improvement (compared with HST)
in the fractional uncertainty of the star formation rate to halo mass
relation and the scales at which the LFs peak (i.e. turnover). Most
parameters regulating the UV galaxy properties can be constrained at the
level of \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$\% or better, if either (i) we are able to better
characterize systematic lensing uncertainties than currently possible;
or (ii) the intrinsic LFs peak at magnitudes brighter than \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm UV\}
{\textbackslash}lesssim -13\$. Otherwise, improvement over HST-based inference is
modest. When combining with upcoming 21-cm observations, we are able to
significantly mitigate degeneracies, and constrain all of our
astrophysical parameters, even for our most pessimistic assumptions
about upcoming JWST LFs. The 21-cm observations also result in an order
of magnitude improvement in constraints on the EoR history.},

Using the well-established, computationally efficient Santa Cruz semi-analytic model, with recently implemented multiphase gas partitioning and H2-based star formation recipes, we make predictions for a wide variety of galaxy properties for galaxy populations at \$z\$ = 4-10. In this work, we provide forecasts for the physical properties of high-redshift galaxies and links to their photometric properties. With physical parameters calibrated only to \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$ observations, our model predictions are in good agreement with current observational constraints on stellar mass and star formation rate distribution functions up to \$z {\textbackslash}sim 8\$. We also provide predictions representing wide, deep, and lensed JWST survey configurations. We study the redshift evolution of key galaxy properties and the scaling relations among them. Taking advantage of our models' high computational efficiency, we study the impact of systematically varying the model parameters.

The medium-deep exposures with five HST/WFC3IR+UVIS filter bands from 79 independent sightlines (∼370 arcmin2) provide the least biased determination of number density for z ≳ 9 bright galaxies against cosmic variance. After a strict two-step selection for candidate galaxies, including dropout color and photometric redshift analyses, and revision of previous BoRG candidates, we identify one source at z ∼ 10 and two sources at z ∼ 9. The z ∼ 10 candidate shows evidence of line-of-sight lens magnification (μ ∼ 1.5), yet it appears surprisingly luminous ( mag), making it one of the brightest candidates at known (∼0.3 mag brighter than the z = 8.68 galaxy EGSY8p7, spectroscopically confirmed by Zitrin and collaborators). For z ∼ 9 candidates, we include previous data points at fainter magnitudes and find that the data are well fitted by a Schechter luminosity function with , mag, and Mpc−3 mag−1, for the first time without fixing any parameters. The inferred cosmic star formation rate density is consistent with unaccelerated evolution from lower redshift.}

	abstract = {A growing number of galaxy clusters at z = 1-2 is being discovered as part of deep optical, IR, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. For a complete picture of cluster formation, however, it is important that we also start probing the much earlier epoch, between redshifts of about 2 and 7, during which these clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of these so-called proto-clusters is currently quite limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection techniques, and many assumptions, we have performed a large systematic study of cluster formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in about 3000 clusters from the earliest times to z = 0. We define an effective radius R e for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass with cosmic time. We show that the progenitor regions of galaxy clusters (ranging in mass from 10 14 to a few times 10 15 M ? ) can already be identified in galaxy surveys at very early times (at least up to z 5), provided that the galaxy overdensities are measured on a sufficiently large scale ( R e 5-10 Mpc comoving) and with sufficient statistics. We present the overdensities in matter, dark matter halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the wide range of structures found in real surveys. We also derive the probability that a structure having a galaxy overdensity $\delta$ gal , defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and we show how their z = 0 masses can already be estimated long before virialization. We present overdensity profiles as a function of radius, and we further show how the projected surface overdensities of proto-clusters decrease as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature and discuss their properties in light of our simulation predictions. This paper provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and Hyper Suprime-Cam surveys.},

We have investigated the environmental dependence of various physical properties within the protocluster by comparing distributions of HAEs in higher and lower densities with a standard Kolmogorov--Smirnov test. At 97{\textbackslash}\% confidence level, we find enhanced star formation across the star-forming main sequence of HAEs living in the most extreme `supergroup', corresponding to the top quartile of overdensities. Furthermore, we derive distribution functions of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass in group and intergroup regions, approximately corresponding to 30 times and 8 times higher densities than the general field. As a consequence, we identify by 0.7 and 0.9 dex higher cutoffs in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity and stellar mass functions in the dense groups, respectively. On the other hand, HAEs in the intergroup environment of the protocluster show similar distribution functions to those of field galaxies despite residing in significant overdensities. In the early phase of cluster formation, as inferred from our results, the densest parts in the protocluster have had an accelerated formation of massive galaxies. We expect that these eventually grow and transform into early-type galaxies at the bright end of the red sequence as seen in present-day rich clusters of galaxies.},

	abstract = {This paper is the second in a series presenting the results of our deep 
H $\alpha$-line survey towards protoclusters at z {\textgreater} 2, based on
narrow-band imaging with the Subaru Telescope. This work investigates
massive galaxies in a protocluster region associated with a radio galaxy
(PKS 1138 - 262), the Spiderweb galaxy, at z = 2.2. Our 0.5 mag deeper
narrow-band imaging than previous surveys collects a total of 68 H
$\alpha$ emitters (HAE). Here, 17 out of the 68 are newly discovered
protocluster members. First, a very high characteristic stellar mass of
M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast = 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.73\} M? is measured from a
Schechter function fit to the mass distribution of HAEs. Together with
the Chandra X-ray data, we find that four out of six massive HAEs
(M* {\textgreater} 1011 M?) show bright
X-ray emission, suggesting that they host active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
Their mass estimates, therefore, would be affected by the nuclear
emission from AGNs. Notably, the X-ray-detected HAEs are likely
positioned near the boundary between star-forming and quiescent
populations in the rest-frame UVJ plane. Moreover, our deep narrow-band
data succeed in probing the bright H $\alpha$ (+ [N II]) line nebula of
the Spiderweb galaxy extending over \~{}100 physical kpc. These
results suggest that the massive galaxies in the Spiderweb protocluster
are on the way to becoming the bright red sequence objects seen in local
galaxy clusters, where AGNs might play an essential role in their
quenching processes, though a more statistical database is needed to
build a general picture.},

	abstract = {We report the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function of \$g\$-dropout 
galaxies in 177 protocluster candidates (PC UVLF) at \$z{\textbackslash}sim4\$ selected
in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. Comparing with the
UVLF of field galaxies at the same redshift, we find that the PC UVLF
shows a significant excess towards the bright-end. This excess can not
be explained by the contribution of only active galactic nuclei, and we
also find that this is more significant in higher dense regions.
Assuming that all protocluster members are located on the star formation
main sequence, the PC UVLF can be converted into a stellar mass
function. Consequently, our protocluster members are inferred to have a
2.8 times more massive characteristic stellar mass than that of the
field Lyman break galaxies at the same redshift. This study, for the
first time, clearly shows that the enhancement in star formation or
stellar mass in overdense regions can generally be seen as early as at
\$z{\textbackslash}sim4\$. We also estimate the star formation rate density (SFRD) in
protocluster regions as \${\textbackslash}simeq 6-20{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the cosmic SFRD, based on the
measured PC UVLF after correcting for the selection incompleteness in
our protocluster sample. This high value suggests that protoclusters
make a non-negligible contribution to the cosmic SFRD at \$z{\textbackslash}sim4\$, as
previously suggested by simulations. Our results suggest that
protoclusters are essential components for the galaxy evolution at
\$z{\textbackslash}sim4\$.},
